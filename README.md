# Hadock Tech

Hi, welcome to my [website](https://hadock.tech) source.
Now you might be wondering,

## Can I take this for myself?
Absolutely, I just realized I haven't set a licence, but if I set one, it's gonna be MIT.\
Do keep in mind I have 0 liability over your code, I don't know how to fix it. This is my first time doing web development.

## How can I host this?
This question probably isn't worth putting here, but why not.\
I'm hosting this using Cloudflare Pages, with a domain i got freely from [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). (Don't worry, if your scared your school won't get accepted, it probably will. Even mine was.)
That's all that I use to host this website, and it's a neat project for me to learn more about HTML and CSS.
